# LiX <!-- omit in toc -->
Lix is a package which bundles other packages and commands. These bundles may be specified when importing the LiX package, either in your own document-class, or directly in your main document, when using a predefined class. The goal of this package is to simplify the process of defining your own class, and to speed up writing your documents.

**Motivation**: \
While LaTeX is the indisputable king for typesetting academic papers, it does have a steep learning curve and is very syntax-heavy. To ease the burden of typesetting and bring the focus back on the content, the syntax should be as light as possible. Defining your own look-and-feel is even more inaccessible, if one is not familiar with basic programming -  hence this humble project, which attempts to address these issues.

**Bundles**: \
The currently available bundles are (in alphabetical order):
```latex
code, configs, cover, figures, formats, header, headings, links, lists, math, refs, tables, titlepage, toc, verso
```

**Classes**: \
Using the LiX package, I have defined some classes, which are ready for use.
- `Paper` is for typesetting academic research papers and university assignments. It builds on top of the article class.
- `Textbook` is for typesetting academic litterature, like textbooks and dissertations. It builds on top of the report class.
- `Novel` is for typesetting fiction, like novels or a short-stories. It builds on top of the book class.

## 1. Examples <a name="examples"></a>

### The `Paper` Class <a name="paper"></a>
This class strives to pack as much information as possible, into a visually coherent environment, while adhering to the standards of academic research papers, like having references, citations and captions. Below is an example. Access the full document [here](paper_example.pdf).

| Source                             | Build (Two-column)             |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| ![p1](screenshots/src_paper_1.png) | ![p1](screenshots/paper_1.png) |
| ![p1](screenshots/src_paper_2.png) | ![p1](screenshots/paper_2.png) |

The paper class imports LiX with these options:
```latex
\RequirePackage[code, configs, figures, formats, header, headings, links, lists, math, refs, tables, titlepage, toc]{lix}
```

### The `Textbook` Class <a name="tome"></a>
This class is intended to typeset a large amount of academic content to be printed in book form. As with the paper class, it focuses on visual coherence, while adhering to the standards of academic printing, like having a cover-, title- and metadata page, references, citations and captions. Below is an example. Access the full document [here](textbook_example.pdf).

| Source                            | Build (One-column)            |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| ![p1](screenshots/src_tome_1.png) | ![p1](screenshots/tome_1.png) |
| ![p1](screenshots/src_tome_2.png) | ![p1](screenshots/tome_2.png) |

The textbook class imports LiX with these options:
```latex
\RequirePackage[all]{lix}
```

### The `Novel` Class <a name="novel"></a>
This class is meant for typesetting fiction with the intent to print. This class supplies cover-, title- and metadata pages using very simple commands. Below is an example. Access the full document [here](novel_example.pdf).

| Source                             | Build                          |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| ![p1](screenshots/src_novel_1.png) | ![p1](screenshots/novel_1.png) |

The novel class imports LiX with these options:
```latex
\RequirePackage[configs, cover, figures, formats, header, headings, links, titlepage, toc, verso]{lix}
```

## 2. Syntax <a name="syntax"></a>
This is an overview of the commands, which are available when specifying a certain bundle (in alphabetical order). To those unfamilier with LaTeX, a command is always prefixed with a backslash `\`, mandatory input is enclosed in `{}` and optional input is enclosed in `[]`. Whitespace between a command and its input does not matter. Comments are always prefixed with a percentage symbol `%`.


### Aliases <a name="aliases"></a>
These are always available.
```latex
\abstract % Prints the appropriately formatted word 'Abstract'.
\add{path/to/file.tex} % Inserts the tex-code from the given file.
\use{package1, package2, ...} % Import packages.
```


### Code <a name="code"></a>
Code blocks will be subtly highlighted according to the given language.
```latex
% Available with the 'code' option.
\code{label}{language}{
    % Your code.
}{caption}
```
For no highlighting, set the language to `text`.


### Configs <a name="configs"></a>
For setting up the basic characteristics of your document.
```latex
% Available with the 'configs' option.
\size{standard}{orientation} % See table below.
\margins{top}{bot}{left}{right}
\lang{language}
```

| ISO-A | ISO-B | ISO-C | ANSI | US | Orientation |
|-------|-------|-------|------|----|-------------|
| `a0` <br> `a1` <br> ... <br> `a6` | `b0` <br> `b1` <br> ... <br> `b6` | `c0` <br> `c1` <br> ... <br> `c6` | `ansia` <br> `ansib` <br> ... <br> `ansie` | `letter` <br> `executive` <br> `legal` | `portrait` <br> `landscape` |

E.g `\size{a4}{portrait}`.


### Cover <a name="cover"></a>
The front and back of a book.
```latex
% Available with the 'cover' option.
\cover{path/to/front.pdf}{path/to/back.pdf}
\blurb{Flavor text for the back}
```


### Figures <a name="figures"></a>
This command will take care of placing your figure correctly and it is file-format agnostic i.e. it works the same for both regular images and vector graphics.
```latex
\fig{label}{scale}{path}{caption}
```


### Formats <a name="formats"></a>
These command names were chosen to ensure that the readability of the source code is minimally affected.
```latex
\b{...} % Bold text.
\i{...} % Italic text.
\u{...} % Underline text.
\s{...} % Strikeout.
\c{...} % Inline code.
\m{...} % Inline math.
```


### Header <a name="header"></a>
The strip of text at the top of each page.
```latex
% Available with the 'header' option.
\header{left}{center}{right}
```


### Heading <a name="heading"></a>
Top-level headings will act like chapters in book-like classes, but as a section article-like classes. Headings will be numbered, unless a `*` is added to the command, e.g. `\h*{...}`.
```latex
\h{...}    % Level one.
\hh{...}   % Level two.
\hhh{...}  % Level three.
\hhhh{...} % Level four.
```
The regular commands, like `\chapter` and `section` can still be used along with their starred counterparts.


### Links <a name="links"></a>
This will eventually support generating a qr-code.
```latex
\url{label text}{link} % E.g. {this website}{https://www.somewebsite.com}
```


### Lists <a name="lists"></a>
The styling of these lists have been simplified. It is of course possible to nest lists.
```latex
\begin{bullets} % Always a dot, regardless of nesting.
    \item ...
\end{bullets}
```
```latex
\begin{numbers} % 1, 2, 3...
    \item ...
\end{numbers}
```


### Math <a name="math"></a>
The label is required and the math block will be numbered.
```latex
\math{label}{
    % Regular latex math.
}
```
Shortcut commmands in the math environment:
- `\mean{x}` $\rightarrow \overline{x}$
- `\Re` $\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ (Real set)
- `\Im` $\rightarrow \mathbb{I}$ (Imaginary set)
- `\N` $\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ (Natural set)
- `\Z` $\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ (Integer set)
- `\Q` $\rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ (Rational set)
- `\C` $\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ (Complex set)
- `\epsilon` $\rightarrow \varepsilon$ (varepsilon)


### Refs <a name="refs"></a>
Reference your figures, tables, math, codeblocks, etc., using the labels, you provided. Cite external sources from your bibliography. Link to external sources.
```latex
\r{label}          % Reference figures, tables, etc.
\R{label}          % Uppercase equivalent of \r.

\cite{your_source} % As defined in your bibliography file

\bib{path/to/refs} % Without the '.bib' extension.
```


### Tables <a name="tables"></a>
There are three types. These three tables will cover 90% of your table-needs, but you have access to the full power of the tabularray package for more complicated tables. The `&` symbol separates items and `\\` separates rows.
```latex
\tabs{label}{type}{
    % Your table content.
}{caption}
```
Types:
- `cols`: Classic table, the top row acts as the header.
- `rows`: The left-most column acts as the header.
- `grid`: Both the top row and left-most column act as headers.

Formatting code for the table can also be given explicitly in the type field.


### Titlepage <a name="titlepage"></a>
Automatically imported, if `cover` option is specified.
```latex
% Available with the 'titlepage' option.
\title    {This is your Title}
\subtitle {And your Subtitle}
\author   {Name Lastname}
\date     {01/01/2023} % \today is also available.
```


### Toc <a name="toc"></a>
Print table of content, as is appropriate for your current document-class.
```latex
\toc
```


### Verso <a name="verso"></a>
The page after the front-cover of a book, which contains formal information.
```latex
% Available with the 'verso' option.
\license   {type}{modifiers}{version}
\isbn      {978-0201529838}
\edition   {123}{year}
\publisher {Your Publishing Company}
\dedicate  {dedicatee}{Messege}
\thank     {people or organisations}
\note      {Longer author's note}
```

## 3. Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The LiX package and all classes work out-of-the-box with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). Simply include `lix.sty` and the appropriate `.cls` file in your project folder.

If you are working locally, you need to have all package dependencies installed. Depending on which bundles are imported, LiX may import the following packages:
```latex
amsfonts, amsmath, amssymb, babel, caption, cite, doclicense, ebgaramond, enumitem, esint, eso-pic, fancyhdr, float, fontenc, geometry, graphicx, GS1, hyperref, inconsolata, inputenc, lastpage, listings, microtype, numspell, parskip, setspace, silence, siunitx, svg, tabularray, titlesec, titletoc, titling, tocbibind, ulem, xcolor, xparse
```
All of which are available through CTAN.

Check up on the [svg](https://ctan.org/pkg/svg?lang=en) package, which has non-latex dependencies. If you have svg's included in your document, the compiler has to be run with the argument: `--shell-escape`.

For VSCode, I recommend installing the [LaTeX Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) extension, and adding this to your `settings.json`:
```json
"workbench.editorAssociations": {
    "*.pdf": "latex-workshop-pdf-hook"
},
"latex-workshop.latex.tools": [
    {
        "name": "latexmk",
        "command": "latexmk",
        "args": [
            "--shell-escape",
            "-synctex=1", // Optional
            "-interaction=nonstopmode",
            "-file-line-error",
            "-pdf",
            "-outdir=%OUTDIR%",
            "%DOC%"
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "pdflatex",
        "command": "pdflatex",
        "args": [
            "--shell-escape",
            "-synctex=1", // Optional
            "-interaction=nonstopmode",
            "-file-line-error",
            "%DOC%"
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "bibtex",
        "command": "bibtex",
        "args": [
            "%DOCFILE%"
        ]
    }
],
"latex-workshop.latex.autoBuild.run": "never",
"latex-workshop.latex.autoClean.run": "onBuilt",
```

## 4. Plans <a name="plans"></a>
- Change delimiter in tables from `&` to `|` and `\\` to newline.
- Add option to generate qr-code to `\url` command.
- Have the code language appear in the corner of codeblocks inline with the vertical separator.
- Add mandatory newline before and after code blocks, maybe using `\par\null`.
- Use `hyperref` to add pdf-metadata, using `\theTitle`, `\theAuthor`, etc. Check documentation to see if this can be done automatically.
